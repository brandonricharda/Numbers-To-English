# Numbers-To-English

The purpose of this project is to create a Ruby program that converts a numerical input into words. To do this, I've taken a unique approach that converts the input into a number with commas and then analyzes each digit to understand what it represents.

To use this program, download the .rb file and run it from the command line. Input your number in the form of digits and the program will issue a result.
